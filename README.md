# Screen-Capture
iOS Project demonstrating how to take a screenshot programmatically.

In the MasterViewController.m you'll find two IBActions, either of which will take a screen grab which is saved to the camera roll.
This project is based on the Xcode 6 Master/Detail template, so hit that plus button a few times to populate the screen.

I've explained both approaches in more detail here:
